# neighbour_code_to_normals is a lookup table.
# For every binary neighbour code 
# (2x2x2 neighbourhood = 8 neighbours = 8 bits = 256 codes) 
# it contains the surface normals of the triangles (called "surfel" for 
# "surface element" in the following). The length of the normal 
# vector encodes the surfel area.

  Finds all surface elements "surfels" in the ground truth mask `mask_gt` and

  distances together with the corresponding surfel areas. If one of the masks
  is empty, the corresponding lists are empty and all distances in the other
  list are `inf`
